# About

I wanted to experiment with [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) and [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com) so I threw together this news feed aggregator. News articles are gathered from [NewsApi](https://newsapi.org/) every minute.

## Demo
https://james-harper.github.io/

## To do
- Split the different parts into their own Vue components
- Transpile, minify and concatenate scripts
- Improve performance
- Add more features - eg saving/removing articles or some way to configure feeds
